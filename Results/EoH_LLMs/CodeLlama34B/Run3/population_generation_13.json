Apply an exponential decay factor to the distance penalty.\n4. Add a term to encourage the use of bins with lower utilization levels.\n5. Set the score to zero if the bin's capacity is equal to the maximum capacity.\n\nHere is the implementation of my algorithm in Python:\n```\n",
          "code": "import numpy as np\n\ndef score(item, bins):\n    # Calculate the distance between the item size and the bin capacity\n    distances = np.abs(bins - item)\n    \n    # Calculate the score based on the item size, the rest capacity of the bin, and the distance\n    scores = np.log(item / distances) + np.sqrt(distances) + np.log(bins) - np.log(bins - item + 1)\n    \n    # Apply an exponential decay factor to the distance penalty\n    decay_factor = 0.7\n    scores -= decay_factor * np.exp(-distances / (item + 1))\n    \n    # Add a term to encourage the use of bins with lower utilization levels\n    utilization_levels = np.divide(bins, bins.max())\n    scores += np.log(utilization_levels)\n    \n    # Set the score to zero if the bin's capacity is equal to the maximum capacity\n    scores[bins == bins.max()] = 0\n    \n    return scores",
