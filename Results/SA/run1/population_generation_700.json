Then, it takes the element-wise division of the remaining capacities of the bins by the item size and subtracts the maximum capacity. Next, it normalizes the scores by dividing them by the sum of the subtracted quotients. Finally, it multiplies the normalized scores by a factor based on the logarithm of the item size.\n\nImplementation in Python:\n\n```",
