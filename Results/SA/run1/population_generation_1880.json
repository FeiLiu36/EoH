The equation takes into account the rest capacity of each bin, the maximum capacity of all bins, and a defined weight assigned to each term. The modified algorithm introduces a new term that calculates the inverse of the item capacity to encourage the assignment of items with smaller sizes to bins.\n\nCode:\n```",
