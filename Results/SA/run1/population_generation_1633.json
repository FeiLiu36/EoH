          "algorithm": "The new algorithm assigns scores to bins based on a combination of factors including the remaining capacities of the bins, the difference between the bin capacity and the item size, penalty terms, and an additional factor that considers the ratio between the remaining capacity of each bin and the average remaining capacity. The algorithm aims to minimize the number of used bins by giving higher scores to bins with more remaining capacity and penalizing bins with a lower number of items already assigned. Additionally, the new algorithm introduces a regularization term that penalizes large differences in remaining capacity between bins and a constraint that ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum remaining capacities of the bins is not too large. The new algorithm also incorporates a modified version of the existing ratio penalty term.",
