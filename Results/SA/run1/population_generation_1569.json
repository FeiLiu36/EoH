It includes a term that considers the difference between the bin capacity and the item size, as well as a reward term that rewards bins with larger remaining capacities and a reward term that rewards bins closer to the minimum remaining capacity in the set of bins. Additionally, the new algorithm introduces a regularization term to control the trade-off between capacity utilization and the number of used bins.\n\nNew Algorithm Implementation:\n\n```",
