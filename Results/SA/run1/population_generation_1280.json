The scores are then sorted in descending order and returned as the final output. However, in this modified version, the decay term will be weighted by a factor of 0.8, the balanced term will be weighted by a factor of 0.1, and the logarithmic term will be weighted by a factor of 0.1.\n\nImplementation of the new algorithm in Python:\n\n```",
