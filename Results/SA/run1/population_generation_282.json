It first calculates the ratio of the item size to the rest capacity of each bin, and then calculates a modifier using a logarithmic function of the difference between the bin's rest capacity and the average rest capacity of all the bins, with the weights determined by the square root of the ratio of the rest capacity to the maximum capacity. The adjusted score for each bin is then calculated by combining the ratio, modifier, and weights.",
