The penalty factor is calculated by dividing the sum of the rest capacities of all the bins by the sum of the assigned items, and then dividing it by the maximum capacity. Finally, the scores are obtained by dividing the ratio, penalty factor, and the logarithm of the ratio by the maximum ratio, and then normalizing them.",
