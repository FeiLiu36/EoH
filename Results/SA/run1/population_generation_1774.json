Initialize the weight factor, power factor, and standard deviation factor.\n3. Calculate the quadratic term by squaring the bins and dividing by a factor of 4.\n4. Calculate the ratio term by raising the ratio of bins to (item - bins) to the power determined by the weight factor.\n5. Calculate the difference term by taking the absolute difference between the bins and the item size.\n6. Calculate the power factor by using a Gaussian function with the weight factor, difference term normalized by the average capacity and standard deviation, and the power factor raised to the power determined by the weight factor.\n7. Calculate the deviation term by taking the absolute difference between the bins and the average capacity.\n8. Calculate the exponential term by using a Gaussian function with the weight factor, difference term normalized by the average capacity and standard deviation, and the power factor raised to the power determined by the weight factor.\n9. Calculate the optimization term using an exponential function with the bins normalized by the standard deviation.\n10. Calculate the scores for the bins by summing up the quadratic term, ratio term, difference term, power factor, deviation term, exponential term, and optimization term.\n11. Normalize the scores by dividing them by the maximum score.\n\nPython code:\n```",
