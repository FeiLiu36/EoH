Calculate the maximum capacity of the bins.\n2. Calculate the ratio of the rest capacity of each bin to the maximum capacity.\n3. Calculate the inverse of the difference between the item size and the rest capacity of each bin.\n4. Calculate the exponential of the ratio of the rest capacity to the maximum capacity.\n5. Calculate the scores for each bin by multiplying the inverses, ratios, and exponentials.\n6. Return the scores.\n\nCode:\n\n",
