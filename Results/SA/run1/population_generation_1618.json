The algorithm aims to minimize the number of used bins by giving higher scores to bins with more remaining capacity and penalizing bins with a lower number of items already assigned. Additionally, the new algorithm introduces a regularization term that penalizes large differences in remaining capacity between bins.\n\nCode:\n\n```",
