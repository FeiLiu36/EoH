          "algorithm": "New Algorithm: Logarithmic Score Function\n\nThis logarithmic score function assigns scores to bins based on the remaining capacities of the bins, the difference between the bin capacity and the item size, penalty terms, and a logarithmic factor that considers the ratio between the remaining capacity of each bin and the average remaining capacity. The algorithm aims to minimize the number of used bins by giving higher scores to bins with more remaining capacity and penalizing bins with a lower number of items already assigned. Additionally, the logarithmic algorithm introduces a logarithmic decay factor that decreases the score of bins with larger differences in remaining capacity. The logarithmic algorithm also incorporates a modified version of the existing penalty term and adjusts the weight factor for the optimization term.\n\nCode:\n\n",
