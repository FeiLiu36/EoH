It then returns the scores for the bins for assignment.\n\n1. Calculate the difference between the item size and the bin capacities.\n2. Divide the difference by the product of bin capacities and bin capacities.\n3. Calculate the scores as the reciprocal of the divided sizes.\n4. Sort the scores in descending order.\n5. Return the scores for the bins for assignment.\n",
