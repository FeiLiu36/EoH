Calculate the maximum capacity of the bins.\n2. Calculate the ratio of the rest capacity of each bin to the maximum capacity.\n3. Calculate the difference between the item size and the rest capacity of each bin.\n4. Calculate the square of the difference obtained in step 3.\n5. Calculate the exponential of the ratio of the rest capacity to the maximum capacity.\n6. Calculate the scores for each bin by multiplying the ratios, exponentials, and subtracting the square of the difference obtained in step 4, and then dividing by the item size.\n7. Return the scores.\n\nCode:\n\n```",
