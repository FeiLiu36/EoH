          "algorithm": "The new algorithm assigns scores to the bins based on a modified scoring equation that incorporates the rest capacity of each bin, the maximum capacity of all bins, and a defined weight assigned to each term. The equation includes a power term that raises the rest capacity divided by the item size to a specified power, a logarithmic term that utilizes the logarithm of the difference between the rest capacity and the item size, and a linear term that multiplies the rest capacity by a specified factor. The weights for each term are adjusted to prioritize the power, logarithmic, and linear terms, while still considering the exponential, square root, ratio, and quadratic terms from the original algorithm.",
