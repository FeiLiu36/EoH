          "algorithm": "New algorithm description: My new algorithm assigns scores to bins based on the remaining capacities of the bins, the item size, and the utilization of the bins in order to optimize bin assignment. It incorporates a penalty term that penalizes bins that are close to their maximum capacity, a term that rewards bins with larger remaining capacities, and a term that promotes bin utilization by assigning higher scores to bins with capacities closer to the item size. Additionally, it incorporates a term that adjusts the scores based on the previous assignment of items to bins, ensuring self-consistency. The algorithm also includes a new term that adjusts the scores based on the average remaining capacity of the bins, to encourage balancing the load distribution among bins. The new algorithm further introduces a term that considers the difference between the remaining capacity of each bin and the item size, promoting better fitting of items into bins.\n\nCode:\n\n",
