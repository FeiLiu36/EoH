          "algorithm": "The new algorithm calculates the scores for the bins by taking the logarithm of the ratio between the maximum remaining capacity and the squared item size plus a constant, multiplying it by the logarithm of the sum of the remaining capacities of all bins plus a constant, then raising it to the power of the weights raised to the power of 4, and finally taking the maximum score across all bins. The difference is that instead of squaring the item size, we will take the square root of the item size and subtract the constant from it before squaring it.\n\nHere is the implementation of the new algorithm in Python:\n\n```",
