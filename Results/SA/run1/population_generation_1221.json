It also introduces a penalty term that penalizes large differences between rest capacity and item size, and a reward term that rewards smaller differences. The scoring function is adjusted by a scaling factor to control the impact of the penalty and reward terms. Additionally, the algorithm uses bitwise operations to optimize performance.\n\nNew algorithm implementation:\n\n```\nCode:\n\nCode:\n",
