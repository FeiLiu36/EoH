          "algorithm": "Algorithm description: \n\nThe new algorithm assigns scores to the bins based on a combination of the rest capacity of each bin, the maximum capacity of all bins, and the weight assigned to each term. It includes a new term called the 'cubic term' that calculates the cubic power of the rest capacity divided by the item size. It also modifies some of the existing terms to further adjust their impact on the scores. In addition to the existing terms, the algorithm introduces a new 'sinusoidal term' that calculates the sine of the difference between the rest capacity and the item capacity. The weights of the terms are adjusted to achieve a desired impact on the scores.\n\nCode:\n\n```",
