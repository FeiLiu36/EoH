However, the scoring mechanism is modified to include a penalty term that increases with the difference between the item size and the bin capacities. Additionally, the algorithm introduces a reward term that is inversely proportional to the availability of other bins with similar capacities. The algorithm then returns the scores for the bins for assignment.\n\nCode:\n\n```",
