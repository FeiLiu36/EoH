It incorporates a modified logarithmic function of the bin index multiplied by the number of items assigned plus one and a power factor of the ratio between the remaining capacity and item size divided by the bin index plus one. The algorithm also introduces a new step where the scores are multiplied by the square root of the logarithm of the bin indices squared to further promote performance.\n\nNew algorithm code:\n\n```",
