The score is calculated by dividing the square root of the remaining capacity by the logarithm of the item size (base 2), multiplied by a constant factor. The algorithm also penalizes bins with higher remaining capacity and promotes the usage of bins with lower remaining capacity by applying a modified penalty term.\n\nHere's the implementation of the new algorithm in Python:\n\n",
