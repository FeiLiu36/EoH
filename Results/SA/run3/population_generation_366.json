The penalty term is calculated as the logarithm of the sum of the item size and the bin size, raised to the power of the remaining capacity divided by the bin size. The remaining capacity ratio is multiplied by the penalty term. Finally, the scores are adjusted based on the inverse of the remaining capacity of the bin squared, with a modified adjustment value of 3, to promote lower scores for bins with higher remaining capacity.",
