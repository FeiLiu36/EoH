It also applies a penalty term to promote more efficient usage of bins, which is calculated as the logarithm of the product of the item size and the bin size, raised to the power of the remaining capacity divided by the bin size plus 1. The final scores are adjusted based on the inverse of the remaining capacity of the bin squared, with a modified adjustment value of 3, to promote even lower scores for bins with higher remaining capacity.\n\nCode:\n\n",
