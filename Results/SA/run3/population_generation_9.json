If the remaining capacity is greater than or equal to the item size, the score is set to the penalty term multiplied by a very large negative value. If the item size is greater than the remaining capacity, the score is set to zero. The scores are then returned as a Numpy array.\n\nNew Implementation:\n\n```\n",
