It incorporates a logistic function of the bin index plus one and a square root factor of the ratio between remaining capacity and item size, divided by the bin index plus one. It also introduces a new step where the scores are multiplied by the exponential of the bin indices.\n\nNew algorithm code:\n\n```",
