The scores are then multiplied by the reciprocal of the hyperbolic cosine of the ratio of the maximum remaining capacity to the remaining capacity of the bin, raised to the power of the reciprocal of the natural logarithm of the bin indices plus one, and multiplied by the sum of the bin indices. The scores are then normalized by dividing each score by the maximum score.\n\nNew Algorithm Code:\n``` \nCode:\n",
