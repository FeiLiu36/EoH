It assigns maximum scores for bins with remaining capacity greater than or equal to the item size, and adjusts the scores based on the logarithm of the remaining capacity ratio and the logarithm of the bin index. The scores are then multiplied by the bin index, and a penalty is added to the scores for bins that have remaining capacity less than the item size. Finally, the scores are returned.\n\nCode:\n\n",
