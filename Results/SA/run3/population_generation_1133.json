It assigns maximum scores for bins with remaining capacity greater than or equal to the item size, and adjusts the scores based on the difference between the sum of the logarithm of the remaining capacity ratio and the bin index raised to the power of 1/5. The scores are then multiplied by the bin index, and a penalty is added to the scores for bins that have remaining capacity less than the item size and the remaining capacity ratio is less than or equal to 0.7. Finally, the scores are returned.\n\nCode:\n\n",
