It assigns a score to each bin based on the remaining capacity, item size, and a penalty term that penalizes bins with lower remaining capacity than the item size. The algorithm aims to maximize the score for bins that have more available capacity and are closer in size to the remaining capacity of the bin. The main steps of the algorithm are as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the remaining capacity of each bin by subtracting the item size from the bins' capacities.\n2. Calculate the penalty for bins with lower remaining capacity than the item size using a logarithmic function.\n3. Calculate the score for capacity based on the remaining capacity and the penalty term using a logarithmic function.\n4. Calculate the score for size based on the item size divided by the remaining capacity using an exponential function.\n5. Calculate the final scores for each bin by summing the capacity score and the size score, or assign a very high score if the remaining capacity is still larger than the item size.",
