The scores are then multiplied by the exponential function of the square of the remaining capacity divided by the bin index plus one, and by the logarithm of the sum of the bin indices plus one, divided by the square root of the sum of the absolute differences between the remaining capacity of each bin and the maximum remaining capacity. Finally, the scores are raised to the power of the reciprocal of the natural logarithm of the bin indices plus one to further promote performance.\n\nNew Algorithm Code:\n```",
