          "algorithm": "The new algorithm calculates the score for each bin by taking a weighted sum of two components: the remaining capacity ratio and a penalty term that encourages efficient usage of bins. The penalty term is calculated as the square root of the product of the item size and the bin size, raised to the power of the remaining capacity divided by the bin size. The remaining capacity ratio is multiplied by the penalty term. Finally, the scores are adjusted based on the inverse of the remaining capacity of the bin squared, with a modified adjustment value of 2, to promote lower scores for bins with higher remaining capacity.\n\nCode:\n",
