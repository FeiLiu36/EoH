The main steps of the algorithm are as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the remaining capacity for each bin by subtracting the item size from the rest capacities of the bins.\n2. Calculate the ratio of the item size to the remaining capacity.\n3. Calculate the exponential of the ratio.\n4. Calculate the square root of the remaining capacity.\n5. Calculate the logarithm of the ratio.\n6. Calculate the logarithm of the remaining capacity and divide by the item size.\n7. Calculate the ratio of the remaining capacity to the sum of the bin sizes.\n8. Calculate the product of all the factors.\n9. Assign maximum scores for bins with remaining capacity greater than or equal to the item size.\n10. Multiply the scores with a mask to make scores of unused bins equal to 0.\n\nHere's the implementation of the new algorithm in Python:\n\n```",
