          "algorithm": "Algorithm description: The new modified algorithm is based on the following formula: score = (remaining_capacity / item) * (1 / sqrt(remaining_capacity) + item / (log(remaining_capacity) * sqrt(remaining_capacity))) * exp(remaining_capacity). The main steps of the algorithm are as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the remaining capacity for each bin by subtracting the item size from the rest capacities of the bins.\n2. Calculate the ratio of the remaining capacity to the item size.\n3. Calculate the reciprocal of the square root of the remaining capacity.\n4. Calculate the ratio of the item size to the product of the natural logarithm of the remaining capacity and the square root of the remaining capacity.\n5. Calculate the exponent of the remaining capacity.\n6. Calculate the product of the ratios from steps 2, 3, and 4.\n7. Calculate the final scores by multiplying the product from step 6 with the exponent of the remaining capacity.\n8. Assign maximum scores for bins with remaining capacity greater than or equal to the item size.\n9. Multiply the scores with a mask to make scores of unused bins equal to 0.\n\nCode:\n\n```",
