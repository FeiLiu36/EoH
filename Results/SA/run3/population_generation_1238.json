It incorporates a logarithmic factor of the bin index plus one, divided by the square root of the item size, and introduces a new factor which is the square root of the ratio between remaining capacity and item size, divided by the bin index plus one. Additionally, it assigns a penalty score to bins with remaining capacity below a certain threshold ratio.\n\nNew algorithm code:\n\n```\n",
