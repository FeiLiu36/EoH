The penalty factor penalizes bins that cannot accommodate the item, the ratio factor considers the ratio of the item size to the remaining capacity of each bin, and the bonus factor rewards bins with a higher remaining capacity. The scores are calculated using a modified formula that combines these factors, and the bins with the maximum scores are selected for assignment.",
