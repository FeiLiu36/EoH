Calculate the absolute difference between the exponentiated difference of the item size and each bin's rest capacity, and the maximum capacity of the bins.\n2. Take the reciprocal of the absolute difference calculated in step 1.\n3. Apply the logarithmic function to the reciprocal values obtained in step 2.\n4. Multiply the logarithmic outputs with a constant value.\n5. Return the calculated scores for each bin.\n\nCode:\n\n```",
