The modified algorithm takes the difference between the bin capacity and the item size, raises it to the power of the logarithm of the bin capacity divided by the item size, multiplies it by the square root of the bin capacity divided by the item size, adds 1 to it, and finally takes the reciprocal of this value. The score of each bin is then normalized by dividing it by the maximum score across all bins.\n\nPython Implementation:\n\n```",
