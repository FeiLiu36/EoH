Calculate the sum of the squared differences between the rest capacities of bins and the maximum capacity.\n2. Calculate the natural logarithm of the square root of the item size.\n3. Perform element-wise division of the squared differences with the logarithm of the square root of the item size.\n4. Multiply the result with the inverse of the maximum capacity.\n5. Return the calculated scores for each bin.\n\nCode:\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef score(item: int, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    max_capacity = np.max(bins)\n    squared_diffs = np.square(bins - max_capacity)\n    log_item_size = np.log(np.sqrt(item))\n    \n    scores = squared_diffs / log_item_size / max_capacity\n    \n    return scores\n",
