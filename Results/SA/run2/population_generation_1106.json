          "algorithm": "New algorithm description: The new algorithm calculates the score for each bin based on the remaining capacity, the ratio of the remaining capacity to the item size, a penalty factor that increases as the remaining capacity approaches the maximum capacity, a regularization term to penalize bins with large remaining capacities, and an additional factor that decreases as the remaining capacity increases. However, it also incorporates a new component that considers the overall distribution of remaining capacities in the bin set. This new component takes into account the difference between each bin's remaining capacity and the average remaining capacity of all bins, and penalizes bins that deviate significantly from the average. The scores are calculated using a combination of these factors and the overall distribution factor is adjusted with an additional term based on the variance of the remaining capacities.\n\nCode:\n```",
