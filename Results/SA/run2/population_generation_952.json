The algorithm aims to prioritize bins with larger remaining capacities and minimize the number of used bins by assigning higher scores to bins that have both a larger remaining capacity and fewer items already present. The exponential factor promotes larger differences in values and emphasizes the impact of the penalization factor, allowing for more fine-tuning of the scores.\n\nCode:\n```",
