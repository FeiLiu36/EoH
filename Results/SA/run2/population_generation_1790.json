It uses a modified version of the previous algorithm, where the scores are determined by taking the negative of the ratio of the remaining capacity to the item size, multiplied by a penalty factor based on the difference between the remaining capacity and the item size. The penalty factor is a function of the difference between the remaining capacity and the item size, where larger differences result in larger penalty values. Finally, the scores of bins that are not used are set to a large negative value.\n\nCode:\n\n```",
