The modified algorithm squares the difference between the bin capacity and the item size, adds 1 to it, and takes the reciprocal of this value. Then, it raises the reciprocal to the power of the logarithm of the bin capacity divided by the item size. Finally, the score of each bin is multiplied by the cube root of the bin capacity divided by the item size, and then normalized by dividing by the maximum score across all bins.\n\nHere's the implementation of the new algorithm in Python:\n\n```",
