The score for each bin is then multiplied by a weighting factor based on the square of the difference between the maximum capacity and the remaining capacity of each bin, and the logarithm of the maximum capacity. The scores are then normalized to a range between 0 and 1. Finally, the scores are sorted in ascending order, but with the modification that bins with a remaining capacity equal to the maximum capacity are excluded from the sorting process. Additionally, the weights of the individual components in the score calculation can be adjusted by optional parameters.\n\nNew Algorithm Code:\n\n```\n",
