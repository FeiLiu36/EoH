The algorithm calculates the scores based on a modified formula that includes additional factors to consider the bin with the maximum remaining capacity, the bin with the minimum remaining capacity, and the average remaining capacity of all the bins. The algorithm also incorporates a penalty factor for bins that have a remaining capacity equal to the maximum capacity, discouraging their usage and promoting the utilization of other bins.",
