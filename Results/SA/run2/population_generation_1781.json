Finally, it sets the scores of bins that are not used to a large negative value.\n\nThe new algorithm I propose is as follows:\n- Create an array `sizes` with the size of `bins` and initialize it with the size of `item`.\n- Find the indices of bins that have remaining capacity greater than or equal to `sizes`.\n- Calculate the scores for the eligible bins based on the division of remaining capacities by the maximum capacity.\n- Set the scores of ineligible bins to a large negative value.\n\nCode:\n",
