We calculate the penalties and bonuses based on the ratio of remaining capacity to the maximum capacity. The final scores for the bins are calculated by combining the base scores, remaining capacity penalty, and remaining capacity bonus. We also introduce an additional penalty for bins that have a remaining capacity close to the maximum capacity to encourage efficient utilization of bins. The new algorithm also takes into account the size of the item and adjusts the penalties and bonuses accordingly.\n\nNew algorithm implementation:\n\n```\nCode:\n\n",
