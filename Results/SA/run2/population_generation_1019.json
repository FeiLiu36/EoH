The penalty terms penalize bins with a large remaining capacity compared to the item size and bins with a large difference in remaining capacity compared to the average capacity. The reward term rewards bins with a small remaining capacity compared to the item size. The scores are then scaled based on the maximum capacity, the average capacity, and the difference between the remaining capacity of a bin and the average capacity. The new algorithm also introduces a priority factor that prioritizes bins with larger remaining capacities and assigns them higher scores.\n\nCode:\n\n```\nCode:\n",
