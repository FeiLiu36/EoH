The score for each bin is then multiplied by a weighting factor based on the ratio of the item size to the maximum capacity of the bins, and the logarithm of the maximum capacity. The scores are then normalized to a range between 0 and 1. Finally, the scores are sorted in descending order, but with the modification that bins with a remaining capacity equal to the maximum capacity are excluded from the sorting process. \n\nCode: \n\n",
