We also give a higher weight to the base scores and adjust the penalties and bonuses to have a greater impact on the final scores. The final scores for the bins are calculated by combining the adjusted base scores, remaining capacity penalty, average remaining capacity bonus, and utilization penalty. For performance optimization, we vectorize the calculations using numpy.\n\nCode:\n\n```",
