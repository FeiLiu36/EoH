The scores are then modified by a function that emphasizes the assignment of items to bins with higher modified scores, and the modified scores are further adjusted by a function that penalizes bins with high rest capacities. Finally, the scores are normalized by dividing them by the sum of the modified scores plus the total number of bins.",
