          "algorithm": "The new algorithm computes the scores for each bin based on the sum of the rest capacities of all the bins, the logarithm of the absolute difference between the rest capacity of each bin and the item size, and the reciprocal of the Euclidean distance between the rest capacities and the item size. The scores are then modified by a function that promotes the assignment of items to bins with higher modified scores, and the modified scores are further adjusted by a function that penalizes bins with high rest capacities. Finally, the scores are normalized by dividing them by the sum of the modified scores plus the total number of bins. The new algorithm enhances the promotion of item assignment to bins with higher modified scores by utilizing a sigmoid activation function, and it ensures consistency by avoiding the use of any random component.",
