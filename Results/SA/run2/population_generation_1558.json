Calculate the maximum capacity of the bins.\n2. Calculate the rest capacity of each bin by subtracting the item size from the bins.\n3. Calculate the scores for the bins by dividing the rest capacity by the maximum capacity, scaling it by (1 - item_size / max_capacity), and taking the square root of the final score.\n4. Return the scores as a numpy array.\n\n",
