The algorithm aims to prioritize bins with larger remaining capacities and minimize the number of used bins by assigning higher scores to bins that have both a larger remaining capacity and fewer items already present. The rank factor allows for more fine-tuning of the scores and emphasizes the impact of the penalization factor.",
