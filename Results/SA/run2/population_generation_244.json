Next, it calculates the sum of the exponential squared differences between the remaining capacity and the maximum capacity for each bin (after deducting the item size), squares it, and assigns it to a variable called 'sum_exp_squared_diff'. Then, it calculates the scores for each bin by multiplying the 'exp_squared_diff' array by the 'sum_exp_squared_diff' array. The scores are then sorted in descending order and returned. Finally, a check is performed to ensure that no bin with a remaining capacity equal to the maximum capacity is used.\n\nCode:\n\n",
