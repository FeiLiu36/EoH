          "algorithm": "The new algorithm calculates the score for each bin by using a combination of exponential decay and normalization. It first calculates the remaining capacity of each bin after assigning the item. Then it applies exponential decay to the remaining capacity using a decay factor. Next, it normalizes the decayed remaining capacity by dividing it by the maximum remaining capacity. Finally, it subtracts a penalty term based on the difference between the remaining capacity and the minimum remaining capacity.\n\nHere's the implementation of the new algorithm in Python:\n\n```Python\n",
