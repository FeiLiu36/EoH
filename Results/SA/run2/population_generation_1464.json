The scores are then modified by a function that promotes the assignment of items to bins with higher modified scores. Finally, the scores are normalized by dividing them by the sum of the modified scores plus the total number of bins. The new algorithm utilizes a sigmoid activation function to enhance the promotion of item assignment to bins with higher modified scores.\n\nCode:\n\n",
