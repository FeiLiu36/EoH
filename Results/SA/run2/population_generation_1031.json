Calculate the maximum capacity among all bins: 'max_capacity' = maximum value of 'bins'.\n3. Calculate the average capacity among all bins: 'avg_capacity' = average value of 'bins'.\n4. Calculate the penalty score for each bin: 'penalty_score' = square of the difference between 'remaining_capacity' and 'avg_capacity'.\n5. Calculate the reward score for each bin: 'reward_score' = 'remaining_capacity' divided by ('item' multiplied by 0.5).\n6. Calculate the priority score for each bin: 'priority_score' = 1 divided by 'remaining_capacity'.\n7. Calculate the scaling factor: 'scaling_factor' = 'max_capacity' - 'avg_capacity'.\n8. Calculate the difference score for each bin: 'difference_score' = absolute difference between 'remaining_capacity' and 'avg_capacity'.\n9. Calculate the overall score for each bin: 'scores' = 'penalty_score' + 'reward_score' + 'priority_score' + 'scaling_factor' + 'difference_score'.\n10. Sort the bins based on their scores in ascending order: 'sorted_indices' = indices of 'scores' in ascending order, 'sorted_bins' = 'bins' sorted based on 'sorted_indices'.\n11. Assign the item to the bin with the maximum score: For each bin capacity in 'sorted_bins', if 'item' is less than or equal to the bin capacity, add the bin capacity to 'assigned_bins' and exit the loop. If no bin has enough capacity, add 'max_capacity' to 'assigned_bins'.\n12. Return the scores of the bins for assignment: 'scores'.\n\nCode:\n\nCode:\n",
