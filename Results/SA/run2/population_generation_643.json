It then assigns additional bonus scores to the bins based on their rest capacities squared minus a discount factor, and normalizes the bonus scores. Finally, it combines the adjusted scores and the normalized bonus scores to generate the final scores for bin assignment.\n\nNew Algorithm Code:\n\n```\nCode:\n\n",
