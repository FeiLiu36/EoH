Each bin's score is then multiplied by a weight, which is determined by the bin's remaining capacity. Bins with remaining capacity closer to the item size will receive higher scores, while bins with larger or smaller remaining capacities will receive lower scores. The final scores for the bins are normalized to ensure they sum up to 1.\n\nNew Algorithm Implementation:\n\n``` ",
