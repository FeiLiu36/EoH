          "algorithm": "The Modified Capacity Score Algorithm with Adaptive Bin Selection aims to assign items to bins by considering the remaining capacities of the bins and dynamically selecting the bin based on its capacity and efficiency, while also promoting balanced utilization of the bins.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Calculate the remaining capacities of the bins by subtracting the item size from the rest capacities of feasible bins.\n2. Calculate the maximum capacity among the bins.\n3. Calculate the average and standard deviation of the capacities of the bins.\n4. Calculate the difference between the remaining capacity of each bin and the average capacity.\n5. Calculate the weight for each bin based on the difference in capacities using an exponential function.\n6. Calculate the ratio of the remaining capacity of each bin to the maximum capacity.\n7. Calculate the efficiency of each bin based on the remaining capacity and the total capacity.\n8. Calculate the score based on the weighted capacity differences, the capacity ratio, and the bin efficiency, penalizing large differences, low ratios, and low efficiency.\n9. Calculate the median of the scores.\n10. Calculate the scaled scores by dividing each score by the median score.\n11. Add a penalty term based on the difference between the capacity of each bin and the median capacity.\n12. Return the calculated scores.\n\nCode:\n\n",
