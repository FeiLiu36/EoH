Bins with remaining capacity closer to the item size will receive higher scores, while bins with larger or smaller remaining capacities will receive lower scores. The final scores for the bins are calculated by multiplying the base scores and the ratio-based scores.\n\nNew algorithm implementation:\n\n",
