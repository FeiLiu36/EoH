Calculate the difference between the item size and each bin's rest capacity.\n2. Take the reciprocal of the absolute difference calculated in step 1.\n3. Apply the exponential function to the reciprocal values obtained in step 2.\n4. Add a constant value to the exponential outputs.\n5. Return the calculated scores for each bin.\n\nCode:\n\n```",
