Calculate the remaining capacities of the bins: `remaining_capacity = bins - item`\n2. Calculate the maximum capacity among the bins: `max_capacity = np.max(bins)`\n3. Calculate the average capacity of the bins: `avg_capacity = np.mean(bins)`\n4. Calculate the difference between the remaining capacity of each bin and the average capacity: `diff_capacity = remaining_capacity - avg_capacity`\n5. Calculate the weight for each bin using an exponential function of the difference in capacities: `weights = np.exp(-diff_capacity)`\n6. Calculate the ratio of the remaining capacity of each bin to the maximum capacity: `capacity_ratio = remaining_capacity / max_capacity`\n7. Calculate the score based on the weighted capacity differences and the capacity ratio, penalizing large differences and low ratios: `scores = np.exp(-((diff_capacity / max_capacity) + 0.5) / (1 - capacity_ratio)) * weights`\n8. Minimize the score of bins with remaining capacity equal to the maximum capacity: `scores[remaining_capacity == max_capacity] = -np.inf`\n9. Return the scores for the bins: `return scores`\n",
