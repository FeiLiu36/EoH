The scores are then modified by taking the maximum value among the logarithm, square root, and inverse squared values. The modified scores are adjusted by emphasizing the assignment of items to bins with higher modified scores and penalizing bins with high rest capacities. Finally, the scores are normalized by dividing them by the sum of the modified scores plus the total number of bins.",
