Bins with larger remaining capacity, weighted by the weight parameter, will receive higher scores, while bins with smaller remaining capacity will receive lower scores. The final scores for the bins will be normalized to ensure they sum up to 1. However, in this modified version, I will also introduce a penalty factor for bins that are already close to their maximum capacity, which will result in lower scores for those bins.\n\nCode:\n",
