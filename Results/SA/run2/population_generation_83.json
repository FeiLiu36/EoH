The algorithm also considers the maximum capacity of each bin, ensuring that bins with maximum capacity are not used. The modified algorithm performs an additional step of sorting the bins based on their scores in descending order before returning the scores.\n\nHere is the implementation of the new algorithm in Python:\n\n```",
