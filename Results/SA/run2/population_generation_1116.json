In this algorithm, the score for each bin is calculated by dividing the remaining capacity by the maximum capacity, multiplying it by a penalty factor that increases as the remaining capacity approaches the maximum capacity, and adding a regularization term to penalize bins with large remaining capacities. The penalty factor is calculated using a sigmoid function, and the regularization term is normalized to ensure values are between 0 and 1.\n\nHere's the implementation of the new algorithm in Python:\n\n```",
