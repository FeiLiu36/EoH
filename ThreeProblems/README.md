# Results of EoH on Three Problems

This project showcases the results of the Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) on three well-studied optimization problems: Online bin packing, Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and Flow Shop Scheduling Problem.

The EoH algorithm is designed for efficient automatic algorithm heuristics. The project provides a quick way to check the final heuristics that were generated by EoH for each problem.

## Files

## Usage

To check the results on the Online bin packing problem, follow the steps below:

+ cd OnlineBP/test

+ python ael_evaluation_test.py, The script will evaluate the final heuristics generated by EoH for the Online bin packing problem and provide the results.
